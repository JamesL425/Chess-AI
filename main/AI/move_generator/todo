bug with magical piece creation
castling perft bug?


# FINISHED FOR NOW
refactor piece to enum class, and square to class
research zobrist hashes, bitboards, hyperbola quintessence
implement magic bit_board solution

//Successfully implement a convolutional neural network
//
//Neural network takes in board state as input and outputs a probability vector
//
//Neurons successfully implemented
//
//Convolutional layers successfully implemented
//
//Pooling layers successfully implemented
//
//Fully connected layers successfully implemented
//
//Backpropagation successfully implemented
//
//Successfully implement a Monte Carlo Tree Search
//
//A suitable data structure is used to store the tree
//
//Rollouts successfully implemented
//
//Values from playouts successfully backpropagated up the tree and appropriately used to adjust the network
//
//Improves at chess over time
//
//Learns chess by itself and improves over time
//
//Can beat simple chess AIâ€™s (~600 elo)
//
//There is a UI that allows moves to be inputted and prompts moves to be returned from the neural network
//
//The UI displays a chess board with the pieces
//
//Menu that gives the option for AI vs AI, player vs AI and player vs player
//
//The UI and chess engine are effectively (and efficiently) connected
//
//Possible moves efficiently generated
